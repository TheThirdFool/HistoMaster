# HistoMaster
A from first principles histogrammer designed for the analysis of ROOT files without needing ROOT.

A small, self contained data analysis package. While not as powerful as ROOT, it allows the user to 
open and analyse ’.root’ files with a quick to install code that is easy to use.  Through HistoMaster
we hope to democratise the analysis of particle and nuclear physics data, and lower the barrier to 
meaningful information.


In order to compile, run the shell script 'compile'. This will produce an executable 'RT' which if run as:

	./RT rootFile.root

Will read the .root file and print the data to screen. At this early stage edits can easily break things
so be a little careful when tinkering.


Enjoy - DFH
